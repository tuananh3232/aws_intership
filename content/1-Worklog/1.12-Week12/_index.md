### Week 12 Objectives

After completing local backend development in Week 10 and FE–BE integration in Week 11,  
Week 12 focuses on building the AWS foundation required for the upcoming cloud deployment (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, CloudFront).

The objectives include:

- Understand essential AWS services that will be used in Week 13–14 deployment.
- Set up and configure an AWS Free Tier account with IAM best practices.
- Become familiar with AWS Console and AWS CLI for DevOps workflows.
- Learn basic compute/networking concepts (EC2, EBS, SSH, VPC) to understand cloud infrastructure before moving into serverless deployment.

### Week 12 Achievements

#### Overview
Following Week 10 (local development) and Week 11 (integration testing),  
this week builds the **cloud knowledge foundation** needed before migrating backend services to AWS.

I learned how AWS organizes its services, how DevOps engineers operate resources using Console and CLI,  
and prepared my environment for real deployment tasks in Week 13.

### Knowledge Acquired

- **AWS Fundamentals for DevOps**
  - Understanding how Compute, Storage, Networking, Database, and IAM support cloud infrastructure.
  - Mapping EC2/VPC knowledge to Lambda and API Gateway architecture.

- **AWS Account & IAM Setup**
  - Created Free Tier account.
  - Configured IAM user, Access Key, Secret Key.
  - Set default region and profile for CLI.

- **AWS CLI Essentials**
  - Checking account configurations.
  - Listing regions, services, and EC2 metadata.
  - Creating/using key pairs.
  - Managing resources through CLI (DevOps workflow).

- **EC2 Hands-on Skills**
