# Summary Report: "AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: AI/ML/GenAI on AWS"

### Purpose of the Workshop
- Provide an overview of the AI/ML/GenAI ecosystem on AWS, focusing on the most important services.
- Equip attendees with practical knowledge of the AI/ML workflow—from data preparation to model training and deployment using Amazon SageMaker.
- Introduce the application of Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock, including prompt engineering, RAG, and building automation agents.
- Create an environment for students and developers to connect and exchange real-world AI/ML experience on the cloud.

### Speakers / Instructors (According to the workshop program)
- **Nguyễn Gia Hưng** – Head of Solutions Architect, AWS Vietnam  
- **Trần Thị Minh Anh** – Senior AI/ML Specialist Solutions Architect, AWS  
- **Lê Quang Huy** – Cloud Engineer & AI Enthusiast

### Key Content & Learnings

#### 1. Overview of AWS AI/ML/GenAI Ecosystem
- **Vietnam landscape**: AI adoption is growing rapidly; demand for AI/ML and cloud-skilled engineers continues to rise.
- **Learning roadmap**: From foundational courses to advanced certifications, emphasizing hands-on practice.
- **Three service groups**: AI Services (ready-to-use), ML Services (customizable), and Generative AI (opening new possibilities).

#### 2. Amazon SageMaker – A Complete ML Platform
- Supports the entire ML lifecycle in a single platform.
- **SageMaker Studio** provides an integrated development environment that accelerates model development.
- Enables MLOps, training automation, hyperparameter tuning, and model deployment.

#### 3. Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock
- Offers multiple Foundation Models such as Claude, Llama, and Titan for different tasks.
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: using Chain-of-Thought, few-shot techniques for improved output quality.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: combines LLMs with private data to reduce hallucination and expand knowledge scope.
- **Bedrock Agents**: enable models to perform multi-step tasks and interact with external systems.
- **Guardrails**: ensure safe content and compliance.

### Key Takeaways

#### Technology Insights
- SageMaker is not just a training tool but a comprehensive ML lifecycle management platform.
- Effective Generative AI relies on the combination of models, prompt techniques, and supporting architectures like RAG.
- Data remains the most critical factor influencing model quality.

#### Mindset & Methodology
- Start with real-world problems instead of chasing technology trends.
- Apply an iterative approach: fast prototyping → gather feedback → improve.
- Always evaluate cost to ensure project feasibility.

#### Practical Skills
- Prompt engineering requires continuous practice.
- Proficiency in AWS Console/SDK is essential for building real-world AI products.

### Personal Experience at the Event

The “AI/ML/GenAI on AWS” workshop provided a clearer and more practical perspective on how to approach AI in a professional direction. The modern AWS office environment, the enthusiasm of the speakers, and their easy-to-understand explanations made the content very engaging.

**The live demo was the most impressive part.** Seeing Ms. Minh Anh build a working RAG system and Bedrock Agent in a short time made me realize how accessible AI prototyping has become when using the right tools.

Insights about **cost management and MLOps** were especially valuable—they helped me understand that AI is not just about building a model, but also about managing, monitoring, and optimizing it continuously.

After the workshop, I feel more confident in pursuing AI/ML on AWS, as I now have a clearer and more practical roadmap to follow.
