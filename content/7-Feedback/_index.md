### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at AWS through the FCJ program is highly professional and well-organized. The learning and working space is structured effectively, enabling me to focus and absorb knowledge efficiently. FCJ regularly organizes workshops, which help me expand my understanding and stay updated with the latest technologies available on AWS.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provided detailed guidance, explained clearly whenever I did not fully understand, and consistently encouraged me to ask questions. I truly appreciate that the mentor let me try and solve problems on my own instead of giving me the answer immediately, which helped me become more proactive and improve quickly. The admin team was also very supportive, preparing all necessary documents and procedures to ensure a smooth working process. Whenever I had questions, both the mentor and admin team responded quickly and provided thorough explanations, motivating me throughout the internship.

**3. Relevance of Work to My Academic Major**  
During the internship, I learned many important skills—from technical knowledge such as working with AWS services to soft skills like teamwork, presentation, and report writing. The sharing sessions from experts and FCJ members gave me new perspectives and valuable insights for shaping my future career development.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
Throughout the internship, I gained a wide range of new skills, including the use of project management tools, effective teamwork, and professional communication in a corporate setting. My mentor also shared a lot of practical experience that helped me build clearer career directions, especially in the DevOps and cloud domain.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously, yet maintains a friendly and enjoyable atmosphere. When urgent projects arise, everyone collaborates and supports one another regardless of their position or role. This helped me feel like a true part of the team, even though I was only an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company offers an internship allowance and provides flexible working hours when necessary. Additionally, the opportunity to participate in internal training sessions, workshops, and knowledge-sharing activities is a major advantage that supports continuous learning.

### Additional Questions

- **What did you find most satisfying during your internship?**  
  I was most satisfied with the opportunity to work directly with DevOps and AWS tasks. Being able to deploy infrastructure, configure services, and troubleshoot real issues helped me improve quickly. I also learned a great deal about DevSecOps practices, including IAM management, CI/CD pipelines, and system operations.

- **What do you think the company should improve for future interns?**  
  I think the program could include additional advanced DevOps workshops, such as building complete CI/CD pipelines, running incident simulation exercises, or conducting mini-projects in teams. This would help interns gain a deeper understanding of real-world system operations.

- **If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?**  
  Yes, definitely! The program provides highly practical knowledge in DevOps and AWS, with hands-on experience rather than just theory. The mentors are supportive, the environment is professional yet friendly, and it is especially suitable for students pursuing a Cloud/DevOps career path.

### Suggestions & Expectations

- **Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**  
  I suggest adding more group practical exercises followed by a final consolidated project. This would help interns strengthen teamwork and apply knowledge in a more integrated manner.

- **Would you like to continue this program in the future?**  
  If given the opportunity, I would love to continue the program. I hope to take part in more advanced topics such as building complete DevOps systems, multi-environment CI/CD pipelines, and AWS cost optimization.
