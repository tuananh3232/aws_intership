###  [Blog 1 - Enhance AI-assisted development with Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS and AWS Serverless MCP server](3.1-Blog1/)
This blog introduces how to enhance the AI-assisted development experience by using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, and AWS Serverless. You will learn why MCP servers are essential in enabling AI assistants to deeply understand the AWS environment context, thereby providing more accurate coding, deployment, and debugging assistance. The article also explains how to set up and use MCP servers with Amazon Q CLI, illustrated through real-world examples such as building a serverless media analysis app, deploying a containerized application on ECS, and developing a scalable web app on EKS. sThrough this, you will see how MCP-powered AI code assistants can reduce development time, minimize deployment errors, and automate DevOps workflows throughout the entire journey from source code to production

###  [Blog 2 - Scaling Data Analytics Containers with Event-based Lambda Functions](3.2-Blog2/)
This blog introduces how to scale data analytics containers using AWS Lambda through an event-driven serverless architecture. It explains how to refactor synchronous data science applications into asynchronous ones, enabling automated analytics workflows, lower operational costs, and Lambda’s autoscaling capabilities. The article also highlights the benefits of Lambda container image support, its integration with SQS, EventBridge, and API Gateway, and key design considerations to optimize performance, security, and cost efficiency.

###  [Blog 3 - Amazon OpenSearch Serverless cost-effective search capabilities, at any scale](3.3-Blog3/)
Amazon OpenSearch Serverless has introduced a lower entry cost with half OpenSearch Compute Units (OCUs) for indexing and search workloads, optimizing costs for small workloads and development environments. OpenSearch Serverless automatically scales without infrastructure management. With three types of collections: Time-series, search, and vector, it reduces costs, especially for small vector workloads. The post also explains deployment options with redundant and non-redundant configurations for different environments.
